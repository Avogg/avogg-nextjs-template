## Avogg NextJS Template

Hello world!

Here at Avogg we love NextJS and therefore need a way to create projects in an efficient way.

## The problem ðŸ˜¬

When starting a new project, we always end up following the same steps: create a project, setup tailwind, setup typescript, bla bla bla... and that took a lot of our precious time to develop our products.

## The âœ¨ solution âœ¨

The solution is pretty obvious: we created this template so we simply need to do a git clone and start working right away!

## Features ðŸš€

The core features of this template are:
* NextJS (obviously)
* TailwindCSS
* Typescript

We're thinking about implementing more features in the future, but this will do for now.

## How to setup the project ðŸ¤¨

It's super easy! You'll see.

Just do as we say:
  
  ``` git clone https://github.com/Avogg/avogg-nextjs-template.git && cd avogg-nextjs-template ```

  ``` yarn install && yarn run dev ```
  
## Thank you for using our tools ðŸ’œ
